## Project of overview
This aim of this project is to utilize linear regression techiques to predict final house sale prices in King County in Washington State. This includes major cities such as Seattle and Redmond. The project is from the perspective of being hypothetically commissioned by Lake and Company Realty in Seattle to produce a model to accurately predict sale prices. Lake and Company will then use these results to more judiciously consider what clients it takes on as well as to appropriately set fees, rates, commissions, and the like. We've produced both a predictive and inferential model for this purpose and we have a few recommendations for Lake and Company based on these models.


## Data
- We utilized a dataset from the King County Assessor's public website, which lists house sale prices and other data for over 21,000 houses in the period from May 2014 - May 2015. 

- We also manually scraped data from UnitedStatesZipCodes.org for a number of additional datapoints and features.

## Methods
After performing exploratory data analysis with visualizations to get a better intuitive understanding of the data, we built a number of predictive models using multiple linear regression. We engineered several features such as distance to the city centers of Seattle and Redmond, among others. Additionally, we created an inferential model to assess the most important feature relationships to price.
