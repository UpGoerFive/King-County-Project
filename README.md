# Predicting Sale Prices for Lake and Company Realty
Contributing Members: Abass Ibrahim, Nathaniel Martin, and Matthew Samson

## Project of overview
This aim of this project is to utilize linear regression techiques to predict final house sale prices in King County in Washington State. This includes major cities such as Seattle and Redmond. The project is from the perspective of being hypothetically commissioned by Lake and Company Realty in Seattle to produce a model to accurately predict sale prices. Lake and Company will then use these results to more judiciously consider what clients it takes on as well as to appropriately set fees, rates, commissions, and the like. We've produced both a predictive and inferential model for this purpose and we have a few recommendations for Lake and Company based on these models.
